# Smoke Check

This skill is the gate between "implementation done" and "ready for QA
hand-off". It runs the automated test suite, checks for test coverage gaps,
batch-verifies critical paths with the developer, and produces a PASS/FAIL
report.

The rule is simple: **a build that fails smoke check does not go to QA.**
Handing a broken build to QA wastes their time and demoralises the team.

**Output:** `production/qa/smoke-[date].md`

---

## Parse Arguments

Arguments can be combined: `/smoke-check sprint --platform console`

**Base mode** (first argument, default: `sprint`):
- `sprint` — full smoke check against the current sprint's stories
- `quick` — skip coverage scan (Phase 3) and Batch 3; use for rapid re-checks

**Platform flag** (`--platform`, default: none):
- `--platform pc` — add PC-specific checks (keyboard, mouse, windowed mode)
- `--platform console` — add console-specific checks (gamepad, TV safe zones,
  platform certification requirements)
- `--platform mobile` — add mobile-specific checks (touch, portrait/landscape,
  battery/thermal behaviour)
- `--platform all` — add all platform variants; output per-platform verdict table

If `--platform` is provided, Phase 4 adds platform-specific batches and
Phase 5 outputs a per-platform verdict table in addition to the overall verdict.

## Phase 1: Detect Test Setup

Before running anything, understand the environment:

1. **Test framework check**: verify `tests/` directory exists.
   If it does not: "No test directory found at `tests/`. Run `/test-setup`
   to scaffold the testing infrastructure, or create the directory manually
   if tests live elsewhere." Then stop.

2. **CI check**: check whether `.github/workflows/` contains a workflow file
   referencing tests. Note in the report whether CI is configured.

3. **Engine detection**: read `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` and
   extract the `Engine:` value. Store this for test command selection in
   Phase 2.

4. **Smoke test list**: check whether `production/qa/smoke-tests.md` or
   `tests/smoke/` exists. If a smoke test list is found, load it for use in
   Phase 4. If neither exists, smoke tests will be drawn from the current QA
   plan (Phase 4 fallback).

5. **QA plan check**: glob `production/qa/qa-plan-*.md` and take the most
   recently modified file. If found, note the path — it will be used in
   Phase 3 and Phase 4. If not found, note: "No QA plan found. Run
   `/qa-plan sprint` before smoke-checking for best results."

Report findings before proceeding: "Environment: [engine]. Test directory:
[found / not found]. CI configured: [yes / no]. QA plan: [path / not found]."

## Phase 2: Run Automated Tests

Attempt to run the test suite via Bash. For this Unity edition:

### Automated Tests

**Status**: [PASS ([N] tests, [N] passing) | FAIL ([N] failures) |
NOT RUN ([reason])]

[If FAIL, list failing tests:]
- `[test name]` — [brief failure description from runner output]

[If NOT RUN:]
"Manual confirmation required: did tests pass in your local IDE or CI? This
will determine whether the automated test row contributes to a FAIL verdict."

---

### Test Coverage

| Story | Type | Test File | Coverage Status |
|-------|------|-----------|----------------|
| [title] | Logic | `tests/unit/[system]/[slug]_test.[ext]` | COVERED |
| [title] | Visual/Feel | `tests/evidence/[slug]-screenshots.md` | MANUAL |
| [title] | Logic | — | MISSING ⚠ |
| [title] | Config/Data | — | EXPECTED |

**Summary**: [N] covered, [N] manual, [N] missing, [N] expected.

---

### Manual Smoke Checks

- [x] Game launches without crash — PASS
- [x] New game starts — PASS
- [x] [Core mechanic] — PASS
- [ ] [Other check] — FAIL: [user's description]
- [x] Save / load — PASS
- [-] Performance — not checked this session

---

### Missing Test Evidence

Stories that must have test evidence before they can be marked COMPLETE via
`/story-done`:

- **[story title]** (`[path]`) — Logic story has no test file.
  Expected location: `tests/unit/[system]/[story-slug]_test.[ext]`

[If none:] "All Logic and Integration stories have test coverage."

---

### Platform-Specific Results *(only if `--platform` was provided)*

| Platform | Checks Run | Passed | Failed | Platform Verdict |
|----------|-----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| PC | [N] | [N] | [N] | PASS / FAIL |
| Console | [N] | [N] | [N] | PASS / FAIL |
| Mobile | [N] | [N] | [N] | PASS / FAIL |

**Platform notes**: [any platform-specific observations not captured in pass/fail]

Any platform with one or more FAIL checks contributes to the overall FAIL verdict.

---

### Verdict: [PASS | PASS WITH WARNINGS | FAIL]

[Verdict rules — first matching rule wins:]

**FAIL** if ANY of:
- Automated test suite ran and reported one or more test failures
- Any Batch 1 (core stability) check returned FAIL
- Any Batch 2 (primary sprint mechanic or regression check) returned FAIL

**PASS WITH WARNINGS** if ALL of:
- Automated tests PASS or NOT RUN (developer has not yet confirmed)
- All Batch 1 and Batch 2 smoke checks PASS
- One or more Logic/Integration stories have MISSING test evidence

**PASS** if ALL of:
- Automated tests PASS
- All smoke checks in all batches PASS or N/A
- No MISSING test evidence entries

## Phase 6: Write and Gate

Present the full report in conversation, then ask:

"May I write this smoke check report to `production/qa/smoke-[date].md`?"

Write only after approval.

After writing, deliver the gate verdict:

**If verdict is FAIL:**

"The smoke check failed. Do not hand off to QA until these failures are
resolved:

[List each failing automated test or smoke check with a one-line description]

Fix the failures and run `/smoke-check` again to re-gate before QA hand-off."

**If verdict is PASS WITH WARNINGS:**

"Smoke check passed with warnings. The build is ready for manual QA.

Advisory items to resolve before running `/story-done` on affected stories:
[list MISSING test evidence entries]

QA hand-off: share `production/qa/qa-plan-[sprint].md` with the qa-tester
agent to begin manual verification."

**If verdict is PASS:**

"Smoke check passed cleanly. The build is ready for manual QA.

QA hand-off: share `production/qa/qa-plan-[sprint].md` with the qa-tester
agent to begin manual verification."

---

## Collaborative Protocol

- **Never treat NOT RUN as automatic FAIL** — record it as NOT RUN and let
  the developer confirm status manually. Unconfirmed NOT RUN contributes to
  PASS WITH WARNINGS, not FAIL.
- **Never auto-fix failures** — report them and state what must be resolved.
  Do not attempt to edit source code or test files.
- **PASS WITH WARNINGS does not block QA hand-off** — it records advisory
  gaps for `/story-done` to follow up on.
- **`quick` argument** skips Phase 3 (coverage scan) and Phase 4 Batch 3.
  Use it for rapid re-checks after fixing a specific failure.
- Use `AskUserQuestion` for all manual smoke check verification.
- **Never write the report without asking** — Phase 6 requires explicit
  approval before any file is created.
